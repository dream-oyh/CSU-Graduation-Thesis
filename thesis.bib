  abstract = {Abstract This paper describes a study of thruster modelling for a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) by system identification using Microbox 2000/2000C. Microbox 2000/2000C is an XPC target machine device to interface between an ROV thruster with the MATLAB 2009 software. In this project, a model of the thruster will be developed first so that the system identification toolbox in MATLAB can be used. This project also presents a comparison of mathematical and empirical modelling. The experiments were carried out by using a mini compressor as a dummy depth pressure applied to a pressure sensor. The thruster model will thrust and submerge until it reaches a set point and maintain the set point depth. The depth was based on pressure sensor measurement. A conventional proportional controller was used in this project and the results gathered justified its selection.},

  abstract = {System identification is a key discipline within the field of automation that deals with inferring mathematical models of dynamic systems based on input-output measurements. Conventional identification methods require extensive data generation and are thus not suitable for real-time applications. In this paper, a novel real-time approach for the parametric identification of linear systems using Deep Learning (DL) and the Modified Relay Feedback Test (MRFT) is proposed. The proposed approach requires only a single steady-state cycle of MRFT, and guarantees stability and performance in the identification and control phases. The MRFT output is passed to a trained DL model that identifies the underlying process parameters in milliseconds. A novel modification to the Softmax function is derived to better conform the DL model for the process identification task. Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude and altitude dynamics were used in simulation and experimentation to verify the presented approach. Results show the effectiveness and real-time capabilities of the proposed approach, which outperforms the conventional Prediction Error Method in terms of accuracy, robustness to biases, computational efficiency and data requirements.},

  abstract = {Traditional learning approaches proposed for controlling quadrotors or helicopters have focused on improving performance for specific trajectories by iteratively improving upon a nominal controller, for example learning from demonstrations, iterative learning, and reinforcement learning. In these schemes, however, it is not clear how the information gathered from the training trajectories can be used to synthesize controllers for more general trajectories. Recently, the efficacy of deep learning in inferring helicopter dynamics has been shown. Motivated by the generalization capability of deep learning, this paper investigates whether a neural network based dynamics model can be employed to synthesize control for trajectories different than those used for training. To test this, we learn a quadrotor dynamics model using only translational and only rotational training trajectories, each of which can be controlled independently, and then use it to simultaneously control the yaw and position of a quadrotor, which is non-trivial because of nonlinear couplings between the two motions. We validate our approach in experiments on a quadrotor testbed.},

  abstract = {Sliding mode control, due to its robustness against modelling imprecisions and external disturbances, has been successfully employed to the dynamic positioning of remotely operated underwater vehicles. In order to improve the performance of the complete system, the discontinuity in the control law must be smoothed out to avoid the undesirable chattering effects. The adoption of a properly designed thin boundary layer has proven effective in completely eliminating chattering, however, leading to an inferior tracking performance. This paper describes the development of a depth control system for remotely operated underwater vehicles. The adopted approach is based on the sliding mode control strategy and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm for uncertainty/disturbance compensation. The stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system are analytically proved using Lyapunov stability theory and Barbalat’s lemma. Numerical results are presented in order to demonstrate the control system performance.},

  abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods are increasingly being applied in Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) providing adaptive control responses to environmental disturbances. However, in physical platforms, these methods are hindered by their inherent data inefficiency and performance degradation when subjected to unforeseen process variations. This is particularly notorious in UUV manoeuvring tasks, where process observability is limited due to the complex dynamics of the environment in which these vehicles operate. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Biologically-Inspired Experience Replay method (BIER), which considers two types of memory buffers: one that uses incomplete (but recent) trajectories of state-action pairs, and another that emphasises positive rewards. The BIER method’s ability to generalise was assessed by training neural network controllers for tasks such as inverted pendulum stabilisation, hopping, walking, and simulating halfcheetah running from the Gym-based Mujoco continuous control benchmark. BIER was then used with the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method on UUV manoeuvring tasks to stabilise the vehicle at a given velocity and pose under unknown environment dynamics. The proposed method was evaluated through simulated scenarios in a ROS-based UUV Simulator, progressively increasing in complexity. These scenarios varied in terms of target velocity values and the intensity of current disturbances. The results showed that BIER outperformed standard Experience Replay (ER) methods, achieving optimal performance twice as fast as the latter in the assumed UUV domain.},

These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

  abstract = {For decades, PID (Proportional + Integral + Derivative)-like controllers have been successfully used in academia and industry for many kinds of plants. This is thanks to its simplicity and suitable performance in linear or linearized plants, and under certain conditions, in nonlinear ones. A number of PID controller gains tuning approaches have been proposed in the literature in the last decades; most of them off-line techniques. However, in those cases wherein plants are subject to continuous parametric changes or external disturbances, online gains tuning is a desirable choice. This is the case of modular underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) where parameters (weight, buoyancy, added mass, among others) change according to the tool it is fitted with. In practice, some amount of time is dedicated to tune the PID gains of a ROV. Once the best set of gains has been achieved the ROV is ready to work. However, when the vehicle changes its tool or it is subject to ocean currents, its performance deteriorates since the fixed set of gains is no longer valid for the new conditions. Thus, an online PID gains tuning algorithm should be implemented to overcome this problem. In this paper, an auto-tune PID-like controller based on Neural Networks (NN) is proposed. The NN plays the role of automatically estimating the suitable set of PID gains that achieves stability of the system. The NN adjusts online the controller gains that attain the smaller position tracking error. Simulation results are given considering an underactuated 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) underwater ROV. Real time experiments on an underactuated mini ROV are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the adaptive trajectory tracking control for a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with an unknown dynamic model and the unmeasured states. Unlike most previous trajectory tracking control approaches, in this paper, the velocity states and the angular velocity states in the body-fixed frame are unmeasured, and the thrust model is inaccurate. Obviously, it is more in line with the actual ROV systems. Since the dynamic model is unknown, a new local recurrent neural network (local RNN) structure with fast learning speed is proposed for online identification. To estimate the unmeasured states, an adaptive terminal sliding-mode state observer based on the local RNN is proposed, so that the finite-time convergence of the trajectory tracking error can be guaranteed. Considering the problem of inaccurate thrust model, an adaptive scale factor is introduced into thrust model, and the thruster control signal is considered as the input of the trajectory tracking system directly. Based on the local RNN output, the adaptive scale factor, and the state estimation values, an adaptive trajectory tracking control law is constructed. The stability of the trajectory tracking control system is analyzed by the Lyapunov theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is illustrated by simulations.},

In this paper, the motion control technology of ROV is studied, the kinematics and dynamics of ROV are analyzed, the kinematics and dynamics models of ROV are established, and the degrees of freedom of the models are decouple according to the control requirements. The fluid damping coefficient of ROV was obtained using Fluent software, and an ROV control system based on sliding mode variable structure was designed. The saturation function was introduced into the sliding mode controller to reduce the adverse effects of buffeting.

  abstract = {Depth control is very important for underwater robot in nuclear power plant, especially when the robot needs to perform special tasks at specific depths under the water. Aiming to realize the depth control for the nuclear environment, the paper proposes a depth control strategy combining fuzzy PID with dynamics compensation based on the fact that the water in the reactor pool is very calm. Firstly, we conducted the hydrodynamics analysis of the developed remotly operated vehilcle (ROV) using ANSYS FLUENT software to get the relationship between moving velocity and water resistance in heave direction. Then, field experiments were conducted to compensate the dynamics errors using least square method according to the real-time depth values collected by depth gauge. After that, the fuzzy PID controller was designed to tune the PID parameters using fuzzy rules based on the compensated relationship between outputs of propellers and depth values. Experiments were conducted with results showing that accuracy of the depth control strategy combing fuzzy PID with dynamics compensation can reach within 3 cm, which can fully meet the requirements of practical application in the reactor pool. The highlight of the paper is that we combine the fuzzy PID algorithm with compensated dynamics equation, which is very suitable to realize the depth control for ROV in nuclear power plant.},

With regard to mathematical system model of the AUV, hydrodynamic coefficients have a dominant effect on the quality of vehicle pre-testing and evaluation, which is crucial to be estimated with adequate accuracy to curb the uncertainty from modeling simplifications. The standard time domain discrete Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithms are two promising numerical approximation approaches for hydrodynamic identification technique with favourable computational complexity and acceptable estimation precision. In this paper, a study with respect to time domain discrete optimized UKF (OUKF) algorithm based on recursive tuning rule and update gradient descent lemma for a typical prototype known as NPS AUV II will be proposed to enhance adaptability and prediction performance of the identification approach with appropriate verification. In addition, Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) noisy model needs to be included into three Kalman Filter (KF) algorithms to further improve the estimation precision and perturbations inhibiting performance. Pre-processing numerical model validation and non-dimensional viscous linear damping coefficient identification based on three KF algorithms will be implemented respectively to provide an assistant preassessment for the vehicle. In accordance with comparable outputs and estimation-experiment errors, the OUKF identification algorithm is certified to be more precise and superior compared with EKF and UKF approaches in the presence of ARMA noisy model.},

  abstract = {Recently non-linear control methods like Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have attracted increased interest in the quadrotor control community. In contrast to classic control methods like cascaded PID controllers, MPC and RL heavily rely on an accurate model of the system dynamics. The process of quadrotor system identification is notoriously tedious and is often pursued with additional equipment like a thrust stand. Furthermore, low-level details like motor delays which are crucial for accurate end-to-end control are often neglected. In this work, we introduce a data-driven method to identify a quadrotor's inertia parameters, thrust curves, torque coefficients, and first-order motor delay purely based on proprioceptive data. The estimation of the motor delay is particularly challenging as usually, the RPMs can not be measured. We derive a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)-based method to estimate the latent time constant. Our approach only requires about a minute of flying data that can be collected without any additional equipment and usually consists of three simple maneuvers. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our method to accurately recover the parameters of multiple quadrotors. It also facilitates the deployment of RL-based, end-to-end quadrotor control of a large quadrotor under harsh, outdoor conditions.},

For this reasons this thesis presents a data-driven dynamics modelling pipeline for a unified flight log(uLog) format. The objective hereby is to provide a framework to obtain a dynamics model without the requirement for additional infrastructure, such as for example a wind tunnel, just by analyzing the flight data provided by the by default on the vehicle installed sensors. The dynamics models are obtained by minimizing a cost function of a parametric model for the given data. The developed framework is demonstrated with several types of different UAV models, including multirotors and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAVs. The obtained dynamics models showed promising results and generated good force predictions. However, it was also shown that the selection of used data is crucial to obtain a model that is well generalizable and represents the underlying physical effects which were modeled. For this more flight data with dedicated maneuvers would be necessary.},

  abstract = {I denne masteroppgaven presenteres en ny dynamisk modell for den populære VTOL-droneplattformen FoxTech Babyshark 260 VTOL. På grunn av sitt design er fartøyet i stand til å ta av og lande vertikalt, gjennom å kombinere prinsipper fra moderne kvadrotordroner og tradisjonelle fly. For mange bruksområder er det essensielt å ha en god modell av systemet, for eksempel for modellbasert kontroll, planlegging og feildetektering. Ved å tilgjengeliggjøre en dynamisk modell av VTOL-dronen håper forfatteren å fasilitere for fremtidig forskning på VTOL-droner, og å muliggjøre bruk av modellbaserte metoder på fartøyet for både industrielle og akademiske applikasjoner. Den fullstendige dronemodellen er utledet fra grunnprinsipper i fysikk, og modellparametrene er estimert gjennom optimeringsmetoder fra systemidentifikasjon. 3D-modellering er brukt for å beregne treghetsegenskapene til fartøyet, og separate aktuatormodeller er identifisert gjennom enkle labtester. Flytestdata er innhentet fra ekte eksperimenter, og kinematiske forhold, stykkvise polynomiske funksjoner og analytisk derivering er brukt for å rekonstruere flyets fullstendige tilstand gjennom eksperimentene. Deretter er den aerodynamiske modellen utledet fra flytestdataen, der en stegvis regresjonsprosedyre kombinert med Equation-Error-metoden er brukt for å identifisere en passende modellstruktur for både langsgående og sideveis bevegelse. Videre så er Output-Error-metoden implementert med Gauss-Newton-algoritmen brukt for å finne modellparametrene som minimerer den kvadratiske simuleringsfeilen til modellen. Til slutt er modellen utvidet med en siste parameter for å fange kobling mellom flyets sideror og pitchvinkel, forårsaket av flyets V-hale. Resultatet av denne oppgaven er en model som beskriver den observerte oppførselen til flyet på en god måte. Tilliten til modellen bygges gjennom residualanalyse på valideringsdata, etterforskning av modellens statiske kurver, individuell parameteranalyse og egenmodusanalyse av den lineariserte modellen for fartøyet. Til slutt så er lovende retninger for fremtidig arbeid foreslått, både for videre utvikling og applikasjoner av modellen. En offentlig tilgjenglig, ferdig implementasjon av modellen finnes på https://github.com/bernhardpg/babyshark\_vtol\_model.},

  abstract = {With the development of the Industrial Internet of Things, drones have been applied to many application scenarios for providing reliable communication services. However, due to being deployed in an open environment, drones often suffer from impersonation attacks, posing significant threats to flight safety. Therefore, designing an effective pilot identification scheme is crucial for the safe flight of drones. Currently, some pioneer works have been devoted to pilot identification. Limited by the insufficient training samples, the performance of pilot identification still needs to be improved. For this reason, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-based drone pilot identification scheme named DP-GAN has been proposed to improve pilot identification performance. Specifically, we first construct a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based generator to estimate the distribution of the collected dataset and then utilize the temporal and spatial relationships among the received control commands and drone attitudes to produce realistic flight data. Moreover, we also designed a three-stage adversarial training strategy to optimize the generator and discriminator simultaneously. Since the well-constructed generator could produce realistic flight data, the pilot identification performance of the discriminator could be further enhanced. After being verified by systematic experiments, the proposed scheme has achieved 94.42\% and 97.02\% accuracy under natural and constrained environments on S500. Thanks to the lightweight system overhead, this scheme holds the potential to be deployed on the drone platform for real-time pilot identification.},

  abstract = {An energy efficient heterogeneous multirotor unmanned aerial system (UAS) is presented in this paper, wherein, the aerodynamical characteristics of both helicopter and quadrotor are obtained in a single multirotor design. It features the energy efficiency and endurance of a helicopter, while keeping the mechanical simplicity, control and maneuverability of a quadrotor; employing a single large central rotor to get majority of the lift and four small arm canted rotors for control. Developing the stable and robust control strategy requires the accurate model of system. Due to the added mechanical complexities of the new design including the existence of couplings and gyroscopics, the modelling through the dynamic equations of the multirotor would not be possible in providing accurate results. Therefore, precise system modelling is required for the development of stable and robust control strategy. This paper proposes a novel system identification method with the objective to experimentally estimation of the precise dynamic model of the heterogeneous multirotor. The approach comprises of the utilization of input excitation signals, frequency sampling filter and derivation of transfer functions through complex curve fitting method. To validate the accuracy of the obtained transfer functions, the experimentally auto-tuned PID controllers are implemented over the transfer functions. Custom designed fight controller is used to experimentally implement the proposed idea. Presented results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for heterogeneous multirotor UAS.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the motion control problem for a 4-degree-of-freedom unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) in the presence of nonlinear dynamics, parametric uncertainties, system constraints, and time-varying external disturbances. A disturbance observer-based control scheme is proposed, which is structured around the model predictive control (MPC) method integrated with an extended active observer (EAOB). Compared to the conventional disturbance observer, the developed EAOB has the ability to handle both external disturbances and system/measurement noises simultaneously. The EAOB leverages a combination of sensor measurements and a system dynamic model to estimate disturbances in real-time, which allows continuous estimation and compensation of time-varying disturbances back to the controller. The proposed disturbance observerbased MPC is implemented by feeding the estimated disturbances back into the MPC’s prediction model, which forms an effective adaptive controller with a parameter-varying model. The proposed control strategy is validated through simulations in a Gazebo and robot operating system environment. The results show that the proposed method can effectively reject unpredictable disturbances and improve the UUV’s control performance.},

  abstract = {Recently, a system identification technique called FiMos-TA (Kang et al., 2022) has been introduced for the accurate identification of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This approach offers impressive performances, such as robustness and accuracy against disturbances and error accumulation, by utilizing a finite-memory-based training scheme. However, a major limitation of FiMos-TA (Kang et al., 2022) is that it requires inverse matrix operations on large matrices to obtain training gains, which severely affects its real-time implementation performance. Moreover, it relies on the amount of variations in the initial weights and the measurement model in finite-memory is insufficiently adaptable to changing conditions. Therefore, we propose a new approach called the two-stage iterative finite-memory neural network (TSIFNN) identification strategy for UAVs that overcomes all the limitations of FiMos-TA (Kang et al., 2022), ensuring not only robustness and accuracy but also real-time performance. We demonstrate the real-time performance, robustness, and accuracy of the proposed TSIFNN identification through a UAV experiment.},

Building on previous efforts, we introduce an updated 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) nonlinear aerodynamic model and its linearized form. The key features of this work include the model’s identification in the stability frame, achieved using estimated angle of attack and sideslip angle, and the use of a propulsion system model to obtained the motor speed data. The stability frame parameterization allows for direct comparisons with a larger set of UAV models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results, often presented in terms of lift and drag analysis. Key advancements include a residual distribution analysis that was successfully applied to identify and correct weaknesses in the initial drag and side force models. Additionally, the paper addresses the unique combination of challenges faced during this study and describes strategies for managing strong winds during experiments, use of a propulsion system model to obtain motor speed data, and utilization of estimated aerodynamic angles. The resulting model is validated against a separate set of maneuvers comprising 10-s-long sequences that include estimated body states, force and moment coefficients, and estimated air data states, (\$\$V\_a\$\$, \$\$\textbackslash alpha\$\$, \$\$\textbackslash beta\$\$), for both lateral and longitudinal maneuvers.},

Different from test-bed based identification methods, the proposed approach estimates all the model parameters of a multi-rotor aerial vehicle, using a single online estimation process that integrates measurements that can be obtained directly from onboard sensors commonly available in this kind of UAV. In order to develop the proposed method, the observability property of the system is investigated by means of a nonlinear observability analysis. First, the dynamic models of three classes of multi-rotor aerial vehicles are presented. Then, in order to carry out the observability analysis, the state vector is augmented by considering the parameters to be identified as state variables with zero dynamics. From the analysis, the sets of measurements from which the model parameters can be estimated are derived. Furthermore, the necessary conditions that must be satisfied in order to obtain the observability results are given. An extensive set of computer simulations is carried out in order to validate the proposed method. According to the simulation results, it is feasible to estimate all the model parameters of a multi-rotor aerial vehicle in a single estimation process by means of an extended Kalman filter that is updated with measurements obtained directly from the onboard sensors. Furthermore, in order to better validate the proposed method, the model parameters of a custom-built quadrotor were estimated from actual flight log data.

More specifically, we will focus our study on 2 sub-problems: the modeling of time-series, the modeling and control of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. These 2 sub-problems will be explored through the modeling of crops, and the modeling and control of robots. To solve these problems, we build on NNs and training schemes allowing our models to out-perform the state-of-the-art results in their respective fields. In the irrigation field, we show that NNs are powerful tools capable of modeling the water consumption of crops while observing only a portion of what is currently required by reference methods. We further demonstrate the potential of NNs by inferring irrigation recommendations in real-time. In robotics, we show that prioritization techniques can be used to learn better robot dynamic models. We apply the models learned using these methods inside an Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller, further demonstrating their benefits. Additionally, we leverage Dreamer, an Model Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agent, to solve visuomotor tasks. We demonstrate that MBRL controllers can be used for sensor-based control on real robots without being trained on real systems. Adding to this result, we developed a physics-guided variant of DREAMER. This variation of the original algorithm is more flexible and designed for mobile robots. This novel framework enables reusing previously learned dynamics and transferring environment knowledge to other robots. Furthermore, using this new model, we train agents to reach various goals without interacting with the system. This increases the reusability of the learned models and makes for a highly data-efficient learning scheme. Moreover, this allows for efficient dynamics randomization, creating robust agents that transfer well to unseen dynamics.},

The objective of the method is to find out the optimal controller gains on the same control structure of PX4 flight stack software without iterative controller tuning. This is achieved through a two-step procedure which consist of aircraft system identification and PID optimized control design. The first step to implement an autopilot system on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) relates to characterizing the UAV's dynamics using a mathematical model. To accomplish the accuracy of the particular UAV control, the process of system identification, which is the estimation of the parameters of the equation of motion, is essential. The measurement of inputs and outputs during manual flight is utilized to determine the unknown parameters of SISO mathematical model using a software of comprehensive identification from frequency responses. Subsequently, the model is utilized for an optimization-based tuning of these PID controller gains offline in order to minimize the requirement of numerous in-flight tuning. The controller is implemented on PX4 autopilot system. The results are demonstrated that the tracking control system has excellent dynamic performance in respect of simple design, high precision, and easy implement.},

  abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) has become a popular framework in embedded control for high-performance autonomous systems. However, to achieve good control performance using MPC, an accurate dynamics model is key. To maintain real-time operation, the dynamics models used on embedded systems have been limited to simple firstprinciple models, which substantially limits their representative power. In contrast to such simple models, machine learning approaches, specifically neural networks, have been shown to accurately model even complex dynamic effects, but their large computational complexity hindered combination with fast real-time iteration loops. With this work, we present Real-time Neural MPC, a framework to efficiently integrate large, complex neural network architectures as dynamics models within a model-predictive control pipeline. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a highly agile quadrotor platform, demonstrate the capabilities of the described system to run learned models with, previously infeasible, large modeling capacity using gradient-based online optimization MPC.

We develop a novel Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC) framework for the AUV to utilize computational resource (online optimization) to improve the trajectory tracking performance. Within the LMPC framework, the practical constraints, such as actuator saturation, can be explicitly considered. Also, the thrust allocation subproblem can be addressed simultaneously with the LMPC controller design. Taking advantage of a nonlinear backstepping tracking control law, we construct the contraction constraint in the formulated LMPC problem so that the closed-loop stability is theoretically guaranteed. Sufficient conditions that ensure the recursive feasibility, and hence the closed-loop stability, are provided analytically. A guaranteed region of attraction is explicitly characterized. In the meantime, the robustness of the tracking control can be improved by the receding horizon implementation that is adopted in the LMPC control algorithm. Simulation results on the Saab SeaEye Falcon model AUV demonstrate the significantly enhance trajectory tracking control performance via the proposed LMPC method.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose RFUAV as a new benchmark dataset for radio-frequency based (RF-based) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) identification and address the following challenges: Firstly, many existing datasets feature a restricted variety of drone types and insufficient volumes of raw data, which fail to meet the demands of practical applications. Secondly, existing datasets often lack raw data covering a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), or do not provide tools for transforming raw data to different SNR levels. This limitation undermines the validity of model training and evaluation. Lastly, many existing datasets do not offer open-access evaluation tools, leading to a lack of unified evaluation standards in current research within this field. RFUAV comprises approximately 1.3 TB of raw frequency data collected from 37 distinct UAVs using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) device in real-world environments. Through in-depth analysis of the RF data in RFUAV, we define a drone feature sequence called RF drone fingerprint, which aids in distinguishing drone signals. In addition to the dataset, RFUAV provides a baseline preprocessing method and model evaluation tools. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that these preprocessing methods achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance using the provided evaluation tools.

  abstract = {This thesis describes the development of a nonlinear flight dynamics model for a small, fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Models developed for UAVs can be used for many applications including risk analysis, controls system design and flight simulators. Several challenges exist for system identification of small, low-cost aircraft including an increased sensitivity to atmospheric disturbances and decreased data quality from a cost-appropriate instrumentation system. These challenges result in difficulties in development of the model structure and parameter estimation. The small size may also limit the scope of flight test experiments and the consequent information content of the data from which the model is developed. Methods are presented to improve the accuracy of system identification which include data selection, data conditioning, incorporation of information from computational aerodynamics and synthesis of information from different flight test maneuvers. The final parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis was developed from the time domain formulation of the output-error method using the fully nonlinear aircraft equations of motion and a nonlinear aerodynamic model structure. The methods discussed increased the accuracy of parameter estimates and lowered the uncertainty in estimates compared to standard procedures for parameter estimation from flight test data. The significant contributions of this thesis are a detailed explanation of the entire system identification process tailored to the needs of a small UAV and incorporation of unique procedures to enhance identification results. This work may be used as a guide and list of recommendations for future system identification efforts of small, low-cost, minimally instrumented, fixed-wing UAVs.},

Dynamic model for yaw is obtained via mathematical modelling and system identification techniques. To instil confidence in the identified model, residuals and cross-validation tests are carried out to obtain high fidelity vehicle model for subsequent stabilizing closed-loop control design. Following the modelling exercise, design, real-time implementation, and analysis of a GA optimized PI controller for yaw is carried out. The performance of the GA optimized controller is benchmarked against the experimental results of a multi-parameter root-locus tuned PI controller and simulated responses of a standard linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. In addition, the efficacy of the GA-PI controller is gauged employing recently developed marine predator algorithm (MPA). The need for a controller with optimized performance motivated the utilization of GA and MPA optimization techniques. The results from real-time pool experiments indicate substantially enhanced performance of GA optimized controller, outperforming other controllers by as much as 22\% in performance indicators such as settling time and maximum overshoot. Furthermore, the GA optimized controller demonstrated far better robustness and disturbance rejection capabilities.},

With the rapid development of drone recognition in the security field, there exist more and more drone recognition methods, most of which are costly and hard to implement. In the context of the rapid development of 5G technology, we propose a method utilizing the existing monitoring network to acquire data and deep learning approaches to detect drone targets to achieve drone recognizing, tracking and positioning. Our approach uses an improved CenterNet model to detect the presence of drones in the video frames. It also takes advantage of TensorRT to accelerate the inference of the trained model and abstract the spatio-temporal features of the drones in each video frame. A proportion integration differentiation (PID) framework is used to adjust the center of the camera and acquire the consequential actual coordinate to achieve positioning. We establish a largescale database, which includes 1097 images of drones in variant environments. Both the COCO2017 dataset and our drone dataset are used to test the original model and the accelerated model of resdcn101 and resdcn18, respectively. Extensive evaluations on both datasets demonstrate that the accelerated models with TensorRT can achieve a higher speed and a maintained detection precision.},

The case study uses a sliding mode controller designed for the BlueROV2. The controller fulfills the design criteria defined for the case study by following the provided trajectory with a low error.

This paper presents the development and evaluation of a data-driven hydrodynamic model for amphibious quadruped robots, aiming to enhance their adaptive capabilities in complex and dynamic underwater environments. The proposed model leverages Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) combined with attention mechanisms to accurately process and interpret realtime sensor data. The model enables the quadruped robots to understand and predict complex environmental patterns, facilitating robust decision-making strategies. We harness realtime sensor data, capturing various environmental and internal state parameters to train and evaluate our model. A significant focus of our evaluation involves testing the quadruped robot’s performance across different hydrodynamic conditions and assessing its capabilities at varying speeds and fluid dynamic conditions. The outcomes suggest that the model can effectively learn and adapt to varying conditions, enabling the prediction of force states and enhancing autonomous robotic behaviors in various practical scenarios.},

To ensure this, we convert the symplectic map to a generating function, which inherently presents a time-series property. Therefore, we approximate symplectic map by a RNNs based on a generating function (hence the name GRNN). In the learning process, each state passing of GRNN need a fixed point to expand around, which make the local prediction error at each step to accumulate in a controlled fashion. By co-training the GRNN and HNN, our numerical experiments show that such structures can certainly be learned from data and obtain the better performance comparing with other methods.},
